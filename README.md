# Python-Script-Automation
This is a python script that automates the Red Hat Products and Services from the Customer Portal, specifically the Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux with additional filtering of the version as 7.4 and architecture as x86_64. This script uses selenium webdriver
for automating the webpage and also includes the idea of pagination scraping.
